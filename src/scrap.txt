Healing Up Buffs
There's two notable types of healing up buffs in the game. The most common for healers to have is written as 'increases healing magic potency.' Skills with this phrasing buff the outgoing healing done from GCD heals only by the person(s) with this buff applied, and it does not affect oGCD heals.

Healer actions with this effect:
• Neutral Sect (AST)
• Fey / Seraphic Illumination (SCH | applies to the whole party)
• Dissipation (SCH)
• Temperance (WHM)
• Zoe (SGE)

The other type is written as 'HP recovery via healing actions.' Skills with this phrasing increase the amount of incoming heals on the target with this buff and the increase is applied to ALL heals, including oGCDs. Many of these skills come from non-healer roles, so it's helpful to know how they function.

Actions with this effect:
• Asylum (WHM | Players must be inside the bubble to receive buff)
• Protraction (SCH)
• Physis II (SGE | AoE buff)
• Krasis (SGE)
• Mantra (MNK | AoE buff)
• Nature's Minne (BRD | AoE buff)
• Thrill of Battle (WAR)
• Magick Barrier (RDM | AoE buff)

Stuff to consider:

Duration
Recast time
shared recast timers
Standard heals
Standard mits
Regens
Magic only/mostly mits
Physical only/mostly mits
Abilities that cannot stack with others but have different names (tactition/shield samba/etc, sch and sge gcd shields, taurochole vs kerachole)
"recovery via healing actions" buffs ALL incoming heals to whoever has this buff (Asylum Protraction Physis II Krasis Mantra Nature's Minne Thrill of Battle Magick Barrier)
Channeling abilities whose potencies increase with time (improvisation, collective unconscious, earthly star)
Targets (self, self and ___, everyone except self and ___ (synastry), party wide, specific player)
On taking damage effects (hp loss, shield breaks, ex liturgey of the bell)
Shields that are a % of max hp
Shields that are a % of hp healed (including overheal)
Healed based on damage dealt 
Heals based on hits (living dead, bloodwhetting)
Taking damage for target
Tank invulns
Blocks
Abilities augmented by other abilities (intervention, lilies by plenary, celestial intersection by neutrla sect, etc)
Abilities that 'consume' other abilities (shake it off)
Max hp increases
Stacks (related: resources like addersgall, aetherflow, and lilies)
UNUSED stacks (lily bell, haima, panhaima)
Parry
Boss Debuffs
Cast time?
Whether it is a spell or ability (gcd or ogcd)
% heals (benediction 100%)
Passive traits that buff outgoing heals, innate defense, etc //this is not related to the abilities themselves, but characters
Guaranteed Crit heals (recitation)
Embrace/Seraphic Veil   //this is not an activated effect, this should be considered a passive regen trait
Heal potencies scaling off hp (essential dignity)
Heal based on damage taken in the past (Macrocosmos)
Kardia //this is not an activated effect, this should be considered a passive regen trait
Abilities that heal at a certain % or activates at end of duration (excog, heart of corundrum)



Stuff that is provided by the user either implicitely or explicitly:
-who is casting
-who the target is
-how long the channel is (how will this impact duration?)
-what second of the fight it is cast at

NOTES:
- shields scaling off heal potency work with incoming heal buffs!
- essential dignity potency = 400+(700 * missing HP%) or 1100-(700 * current HP%) (400-1100 potency)

ASK THE BALANCE
-bloodbath scaling
-brutal shell uptime for purposes of heart of corundrum
